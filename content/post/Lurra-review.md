Lurra's approach to Northern Spain's cuisine is simple, elegant and delicious. As one beautiful dish follows another it's hard to ignore the care and diligence that's happening in the open kitchen just a few meters away. The friendly, knowledgeable service paired with exceptionally well delivered spanish classics left us feeling like we've found something really rather special.

*Lurra - 9 Seymour Pl, Marylebone, London W1H 5BA*

Our trip to Lurra began with me dragging my rather oversized electric bike out of our excruciatingly narrow front door. We whiled away our morning slowly meandering through the streets of North London to eventually arrive in Marylebone. We were greeted by the very friendly, head waiter who exploded out of the restaurant as he saw me wrestling with my bike lock. He very kindly offered to store my bike in the restaurant courtyard, an early taste of the excellent service that awaited us.

We took our seats next to the window looking out to the courtyard and started examining the menu. The menu is separated into four main sections (not including sides and desserts). The first section consists of starters from which we ordered the bone marrow and jamon croquettas. Next is the tapas section. From here we chose the surprisingly gigantic octopus and the asparagus, jamon and poached egg dish. We didn't order anything from todays specials. Lastly, the sharing plates section at the bottom of the menu is home to the 14 year old "Galician Blond" bone-in ribeye steak we ordered. Along with the above we had a side of fries, and a dessert (which we'll wax lyrical about later). This is categorically too much food for two people. In the spirit of stupidity we ordered it all anyway, attempting to convince ourselves it was all in the name of research.

The first food to arrive was the jamon croquettas. They were presented beautifully on a wooden board and accompanied with a pea sized portion of aioli. Biting into the perfectly crisp exterior my taste buds were met by a deep jamon flavour, setting these apart from the usual suspects. This place takes cured meat pretty seriously and it really makes a difference.

After a bite of the croquettas a very substantial chopping board arrived at the table laden with three hunks of sourdough and two pieces of bone - brimming with bubbling marrow. The marrow was rich and luxurious, they definitely didn't forget to season it. The sourdough is lightly toasted and possibly the best sourdough I've ever had. The waiter told us it's made in a Michelin star restaurant in Fitzrovia (whose name we of course forgot to write down). In fact, I think it's worth a phone call to figure out, I need more of that sourdough in my life. For £5.90 this felt like a really good value dish and tremendously high quality.

Once we'd cleared through the starters the "Tapas" started arriving. If, like us, you associated the word tapas with small dishes, this is where you're in for a shock. A whole octopus arrived at the table, looking utterly stunning. The octopus has been boiled and then finished on the chargoal grill to give it a soft texture on the inside and a slightly crisp, charred vibe on the outside. The octopus was brilliantly executed, and although some versions of octopus we've eaten often char the outside a little more (which is quite nice in all honesty), this felt like a more honest representation of octopus. If you're into octopus, this is a must order.

At the same time as the octopus arrived the jamon, asparagus and egg dish also turned up. It's classic flavours dialled up to 11. The deliciously deep and salty jamon is matched by the earthy asparagus, nutty Manchego and delicate slow cooked hens egg. This dish was a real symphony and in many ways represents Lurra's ability to elevate through quality of ingredients and a great understanding of flavour.

After a short break, which we requested due to our deep regret of not wearing elasticated trousers and a quite real fear that we might not need to eat anything ever again, the beef arrived. Let me start by laying out why we chose to order this dish, the beef is from a 14 year old cow which is fairly unusual and got us thinking that the more aged the better, right? The ribeye was cooked and seasoned perfectly however the deep taste was more akin to dairy meat than the more standard steaks you might see elsewhere. This steak had a very pungent depth of flavour which we find a little less appealing than a younger cow. At £72.00 it is probably the only dish we wouldn't order again, particularly after seeing the Turbot, which looked fantastic.

When the prospect of eating another mouthful seems unfathomable, its just about time to peruse the dessert menu. We chose the Torrijas a classic Spanish dessert which is fundamentally french toast on steroids. The main event was served with stewed strawberry's and vanilla ice cream. I still think about this desert regularly and have frequently considered popping in on my way home from work to feast again on its rich, creamy goodness, so basically, please order it.

All in we ended up spending a little over £230, so it was by no means a cheap lunch. We did order far too much food, and the most expensive glasses of wine so it doesn't have to be that much for your visit. Which I suggest you do.
