⭐️⭐️⭐️.5

After weeks of excitment looking forward to some decent Mexican food, Mestizo doesn't entirely dissapoint but also doesn't quite match some of those giddy highs we've found further afield in California. The Deli is well worth a trip, and so is the restaurant if you're in the area and looking for some Mexican grub.
