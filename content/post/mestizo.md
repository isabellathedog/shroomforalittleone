Authentic, tasty Mexican food provided a delicious lunch but perhaps lacks the pizazz of Californian Baja that gave life to our love affair with Mexican nosh.

**Shroom score: 7 / 10**

*Mestizo Mexican Restaurant - 103 Hampstead Rd, Kings Cross, London NW1 3EL*

Let’s start with where this whole thing began, a small town called Encinitas North of San Diego on the glistening California coast. Our endeavor to live within a measly budget while travelling through California lead us to stay in small towns just outside of where we thought we wanted to be, Encinitas was one of these, we’ll drive to San Diego we said, it’s not too far, we never made it to San Diego, instead we fell in love with this small town, filled with kind people, enjoying the surf and the fantastic Baja food. Now back in London we are on the hunt for the cities best Mexican food, and where better to start than Mestizo with 4.3 on Google it has found itself as our very first review.

The food is authentic; they aren’t offering wedges of lime with every dish, the flavours are umami and deep, the music is hispanic as are all of the staff and they’ll have you in a sombrero downing Tequila should you mention it’s your birthday. I’ll point out now that the menu is vast and hence a little intimidating at first glance, given the service is somewhat lacking you can develop an ‘order now or wait forever’ mentality and risk panic order, do your best not to! 

A plate of homemade chips and salsa (verde or roasted tomatillo) will arise spontaneously at the table while you order, we had the roasted tomatillo salsa which was smoky, salty and rich, the chips edged on stale but held the delicious deep taste of corn in tact.

To drink we went non-alcoholic (so can’t comment on the vast array of Tequila in stock) Ed ordered the Cozumel, banana, coconut and pineapple juice was a creamy, sour and sweet delight, I went for Agua de Jamaica which was suitably refreshing and hibiscus-y but perhaps just an expensive Ribena afterall.

To eat we started with the Carnitos (roast pork tacos) and Chicken Mole taco. All taco’s here are served ‘family style’ AKA you make it yourself, the tacos themselves arrive at the table in a red gingham taco cosy (tea cosy hybrid genius) which keeps the taco piping hot while adding a twist of kitsch, perfect if not a little unhygienic perhaps.

The pork is in fact very pork-y, seasoned to perfection it verged on a splash dry and overly fatty, served with salsa verde, white onion and coriander. The salsa does the best it can to zest up the whole thing, but unless delivered in huge quantity falls on deaf ears to the salt/fat/pork combo it’s attempting to defeat. It was tasty and believe me, 4 hours after eating I can still taste it now, call me unsophisticated, but I wanted more flavour diversity in the dish.

The chicken mole was sweet and nutty with a brilliant depth of flavour, the Queso Fresco that accompanies it is the perfect mix of salty, creamy, freshness reminiscent of Parmesan or Comte. The actual chicken seemed to be breast which is naturally a drier cut of the bird and it did live up to that nature, this was however easily hidden by the drenching of wholesome mole sauce. Overall it was a nice dish, we did find ourselves adding in the salsa verde and onions from the pork to give the set-up an acidity boost.

After a long wait, our main course Molcajete Mestizo arrives. A house speciality dish for two or more. A bubbling stew like dish served in a volcanic rock pot, we opted for chicken and beef arriving at the table topped with sliced Chorizo, grilled spring onion and cactus it did not disappoint on theatre. This is served with 4 corn tacos and according to the menu, a choice of salsa which we never saw. Super tasty and rich you’ll fill up quickly. The chorizo is a brilliant addition as are the grilled spring onions, the dish is full of flavour and depth giving you the impulse to go back for more again and again despite being nauseatingly full. All in all our favourite part of the meal.

At this point we’ve vastly over ordered and have a goody bag full of leftovers, but in the spirit of dedicating ourselves to our first ever review we opted for the churros for dessert. A plate full of delicate, perfectly crisp churros arrive a few minutes later and we temporarily forget how full we were and devour them in no time. Dipped into either of the condensed milk sauces these delicious little sticks prove to be our second real highlight of the meal.

After another wait our bill finally arrives and comes in at £71 for the two of us, bear in mind we had no alcohol.

Overall our excitement might have got the better of us, an experience potentially derailed by numerous conversations about how excited we were to go. The food was good, and certainly worth a visit if you’re around Camden or Euston but left us both feeling like maybe we prefer the slightly trashier American take on Mexican. 

Shroom score 7 / 10
