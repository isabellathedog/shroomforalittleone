⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A deeply authentic experience in the heart of china town. Baiwei has teamed up with Fuchsia Dunlop to bring vibrant and powerful dishes from the streets of Sichuan to the heart of London. Not for the feint hearted perhaps, but a pilgramage well worth the effort for those looking for something different.
