I love roast chicken. So imagine how excited I was when I stumbled upon a creation that made me question why I'd ever done it another way. This recipe elevates the predicatble roast chicken into something really rather tasty.

This recipe is very simple and made up of things you tend to have laying around the fridge/pantry. The shallots absorb all of the garlic-y mustard deliciousness and the meat itself is incredibly succulent due to the vinegar in the mustard. This isn’t your classic super crispy skinned chicken, but the rest certainly makes up for it. 

### Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken 
- 1 small bag of banana shallots
- 2 tbsp French mustard
- 5 crushed garlic cloves
- Handful of rosemary stalks (about 5-8), 3-4 with leaves stripped off stalk, we tend to steal ours from our neighbors front garden 
- 1 tbsp dried thyme 
- 1 tbsp olive oil plus a little extra
- 1 tbsp sea salt (Malden?)
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 100g salted butter

### Method

Preheat the oven to 180°C fan.

Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes before cooking. 
Sit the chicken in the roasting tray it will be cooked in. Peel and half the shallots and add to the pan.

Place the crushed garlic, thyme, french mustard and rosemary leaves on to the chicken with the olive oil. Using your hands coat the chicken in the mustard-y, herby goodness.

Cut the butter into small sticks and cram into any of the birds crevasses that it will fit. 
Place a couple of stems of rosemary inside the bird, and the rest in the tray with the shallots. 
With the extra olive oil coat the shallots and position tightly around the bird, with some lodged underneath where possible. The tight packing of shallots around the chicken will allow them to absorb all of the chicken and mustard juices and also stop them from becoming overly charred in the oven.

Finally season the chicken and onions liberally with about a 1tbsp of sea salt and a covering of freshly ground pepper.
Place in the onion for 70 minutes or so. I tend to cook for an hour and then check the colour of the juices at 10 minute intervals, once the juices near the bone run clear, your bird is ready to be devoured, after a 10 minute rest.
