We have developed this recipe over a few attempts and we’re really happy with this version. At first glance it may appear terribly labour intensive, but honestly, it spends such a long time sat in the oven you can galavant your way through a Sunday and smugly pull this out the oven after a day of activities. We have included a dream team of ingredients, if you aren't able to get everything it isn’t the end of the world. The dried chillies can be tricky to lay your hands on, we have previously used Sainsburys chipotle paste (I say the supermarket because we have tried loads; Sainsbury’s is the best) and also, Waitrose Chilli Con Carne paste packs a good punch too. 

### Ingredients
![Raw beef short rib](/img/MexicanBeefShortRibTacos/rawbeef.jpg)

- 1.6 kg Beef Short Rib
- 5 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp paprika 
- 1 tsp sweet smoked paprika
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon 
- 1½ tsp dried thyme 
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 large white onion roughly diced
- 4 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 3 sticks of celery sliced
- 1 bulb of garlic (or about 10 cloves), roughly chopped
- 4 dried Ancho chilli
- 3 dried Chipotle chilli
- 1 fresh red chilli, roughly chopped (leave the seeds in for extra heat)
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 handful of sun-dried tomatoes
- 5 anchovy fillets
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1.5 litres of beef stock 
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 4 star anise
- 2 squares of Lindt 90% dark chocolate 
- 1 tbsp sugar 

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 165°C fan. 
2. Place the cumin, paprika's, ground cinnamon, thyme and salt in a bowl and mix to combine. Lay the beef on a tray/flat bottomed bowl and pour over the vegetable oil to coat fully, then add the spice mix. Using your hands ensure that the beef is fully coated in the spices. Leave to rest at room temperature.

3. Place a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the Ancho and Chipotle chilli to the dry pan and heat until pliable and soft, approximately 1-2 minutes. Remove from the pan and allow to cool.

4. Turn the heat to high in preparation to sear the beef, ensure that the pan is smoking hot. Sear the beef on all sides, we did this in two rounds to avoid overcrowding the pan and losing heat.

5. Place the beef back in to its original bowl, reduce the heat to medium and add in the onion, carrots, celery and garlic. You may need to add in some extra oil if the pan is looking a bit dry. Fry off the vegetables for 3-4 minutes or until they have started to soften but not brown. 
6. While the vegetables are cooking deseed and core the dried chillies and roughly chop in to ½ inch pieces. The chopping isn’t hugely important as these will cook down and eventually be blended. 
7. Add the dried chilli, fresh chilli, tomato puree, anchovy fillets and sundried tomatoes to the vegetables and fry for 3-4 minutes.  Squeeze in the juice of one lime to deglaze the pan. 
8. Place the beef back into the pan, scraping any delicious resting juices with it. Finally pour in the beef stock so that the beef is mostly submerged, and add in a cinnamon stick, 4 star anise and a tbsp of sugar. Bring to a simmer and place in preheated oven for xxx hours or until the beef is soft and falling off of the bone.

9. Bring the beef out of the oven and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. 
10. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside. Skim off the fat from the remaining sauce in the pan, then pour the sauce into a food processor and whizz up until smooth. 
11. Remove the bone from the beef and pull off any fatty tendons. Shred beef and pour over half of the sauce from the food processor.
