This beef is intensely flavourful, rich and brimming with umami brilliance. It's one of our favourite things to cook at home. We use it to create delicious tacos or a punchy chilli con carne which will leave your guests diving in for thirds.

Warning: This can come out a little spicy. Not really zingy burnt tongue spicy but deep hearty spicy.

We have developed this recipe over a few attempts and we’re really happy with this version. At first glance it may appear terribly labour intensive, but honestly, it spends such a long time sat in the oven you can galavant your way through a Sunday and smugly pull this out the oven after a day of activities. We have included a dream team of ingredients, if you aren't able to get everything it isn’t the end of the world. The dried chillies can be tricky to lay your hands on, we have previously used Sainsburys chipotle paste (I say the supermarket because we have tried loads; Sainsbury’s is the best) and also, Waitrose Chilli Con Carne paste packs a good punch too. 

### Ingredients
![Raw beef short rib](/img/MexicanBeefShortRibTacos/rawbeef.jpg)

- 1.6 kg Beef Short Rib
- 5 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp paprika 
- 1 tsp sweet smoked paprika
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon 
- 1½ tsp dried thyme 
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 large white onion roughly diced
- 4 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 3 sticks of celery sliced
- 1 bulb of garlic (or about 10 cloves), roughly chopped
- 4 dried Ancho chilli
- 3 dried Chipotle chilli
- 1 fresh red chilli, roughly chopped (leave the seeds in for extra heat)
- 1 tbsp tomato puree
- 1 handful of sun-dried tomatoes
- 5 anchovy fillets
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 litres of beef stock 
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 4 star anise
- 2 squares of Lindt 90% dark chocolate 
- 1 tbsp sugar 

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 165°C fan. 
2. Place the cumin, paprika's, ground cinnamon, thyme and salt in a bowl and mix to combine. Lay the beef on a tray/flat bottomed bowl and pour over the vegetable oil to coat fully, then add the spice mix. Using your hands ensure that the beef is fully coated in the spices. Leave to rest at room temperature.

3. Place a casserole pan on a medium heat, add the Ancho and Chipotle chilli to the dry pan and heat until pliable and soft, approximately 1-2 minutes. Remove from the pan and allow to cool.

4. Turn the heat to high in preparation to sear the beef, ensure that the pan is smoking hot. Sear the beef on all sides, we did this in two rounds to avoid overcrowding the pan and losing heat.

5. Place the beef back in to its original bowl, reduce the heat to medium and add in the onion, carrots, celery and garlic. You may need to add in some extra oil if the pan is looking a bit dry. Fry off the vegetables for 3-4 minutes or until they have started to soften but not brown. 
6. While the vegetables are cooking deseed and core the dried chillies and roughly chop in to ½ inch pieces. The chopping isn’t hugely important as these will cook down and eventually be blended. 
7. Add the dried chilli, fresh chilli, tomato puree, anchovy fillets and sundried tomatoes to the vegetables and fry for 3-4 minutes.  Squeeze in the juice of one lime to deglaze the pan. 
8. Place the beef back into the pan scraping any delicious resting juices with it. Finally pour in the beef stock and top up with water so that the beef is mostly submerged, then add in a cinnamon stick, 2 star anise and a tbsp of sugar. Bring to a simmer and place in preheated oven for 3-3.5 hours or until the beef is soft and falling off of the bone.

9. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. 
10. Remove the beef from the pan and set aside. At this point you will need to skim off the fat from the sauce if you leave it in, the sauce will be too fatty and sickly. I find it easiest to lay kitchen towel on the sauce as it absorbs the fat quickly and leaves the sauce in peace. Pour the sauce into a food processor and whizz up until smooth. Taste the sauce and check for seasoning, you may want to add more salt or even some honey to counter any bitterness.

11. Remove the bones from the beef and pull off any fatty tendons. Shred the beef and coat in the sauce from the food processor. We tend to use between half and two thirds, but adjust for your taste.

12. If you are using the beef for tacos, refridgerate the rest of the sauce to make a delicious chille con carne later in the week or pop in the freezer for a later date. 


### Beef Tacos 
To make tacos the first thing you'll need to lay your hands on are corn tortillas or even better make your own. 

![raw taco](/img/MexicanBeefShortRibTacos/rawtacos.jpg)
UK supermarkets offer a huge array of flour tortillas but they just don't compare to the delicious taste of corn these have. We made our own by simply mixing warm water, salt and [masa harina flour](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Maseca-Harina-White-Tortilla-Flour/dp/B07CT1J7BK/ref=asc_df_B07CT1J7BK/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310843163501&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4719836386772043153&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045605&hvtargid=pla-699720111055&psc=1).

We team the beef with sliced pineapple (I recognise this may sound totally mental, but honestly it's so ruddy delicious you will never look back), white cabbage doused in lime juice and top with avocado, red chilli and salsa verde. There you have it, the most long winded beef taco recipe on the worldwide web, but seriously it is absolutely worth the faff.
