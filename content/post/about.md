 We're Polly and Ed, a couple who live in Crouch End, London. We're garlic loving, grilling mad, food obsessed humans with a penchant for turning real life in to a real musical. Here we share our journey through the culinary paradise of London and wherever else we find ourselves lucky enough to explore. Ed covers the imagery shown on the site (brand spanking camera in tow, go easy on the lad) and I, Polly do most of the writing.

 We like to eat across a wide spectrum of restaurants, ranging from splendidly refined Michelin star experiences to the down right rude customer service that accompanies some of the most delicious plates we've devoured from far afield. In fact, most of the food that leaves us raving about flavour on the tube journey home is the more modestly rustic establishments brimming with character and authenticity. 

 Our love of eating out is matched only by our complete obsession with cooking, spending hours in the kitchen experiementing with flavours and ingredients or simply re-hashing old favourites quite often resulting in a 10 0'Clock dinner, expect to see some very dark photos. When following a recipe we stand by a few firm rules always double the quantity of garlic, you'll probably need more curry paste than that and for goodness sakes, season to taste. 

 We started this blog to document our food experiences. Ed and I met nearly two years ago, our relationship ignited an eagerness in both of us to cook better food and learn as much as we could about flavour (could really just be loads of salt but worth a look anyway). This is a space for us to write it all down and do our very best to not forget all of the brilliant meals we eat, and the memories they evoke in us. 

 In our weekday daytime versions, Ed works in technology for a green energy company, with a rampant mission to create a zero carbon grid. Ed is an intense learner and rather frustratingly can throw his hand at just about anything, in more recent months we've had 3D rendering, detailed eye drawings and a pricey trip to Curry's camera department in the quest to find a task he cannot master. 
 
 I run our small London based holiday rental business which offers boutique appartements for discerning holiday makers, named after our teddy bear, Paddington Adventures. I am a former florist and tend to watch Ed learn his new skills from the confines of our courtyard, preferably ploughing through a bag of compost potting plant after plant.

 Should you have found this organically, welcome, please be kind and don't bloody troll us, I'll probably cry, seriously I cried at an article in the Waitrose Weekender, I'll definitely cry.
